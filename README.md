This is a snapshot of a forum I'm building for some clients. This snapshot does NOT include the previous git commits I've made, as they contained sensitive information of my client.


INSTALLATION:
To run you will need to install Meteor.

Cd into the folder and type
"Meteor npm install"
To install all 190 npm dependencies.
These should install w/o error. But you may need to install some development dependencies like node/npm.

Assuming all those install fine. Then run.
"Meteor run"
And the site will be hosted on localhost:3000 in your browser.
